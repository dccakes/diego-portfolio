## Overview

As a member of the Technical Steering Committee for the Open Data Contract Standard, I contribute to defining industry-wide standards for how organizations structure, document, and govern their data contracts and data products.

## The Problem

Modern data platforms face critical challenges:
- Lack of standardized ways to define data contracts between producers and consumers
- Inconsistent documentation of data products across organizations
- Difficulty ensuring data quality and governance at scale
- No common language for expressing data expectations and SLAs

## The Solution

The Open Data Contract Standard and Open Data Product Standard provide:

### Open Data Contract Standard

A specification that defines:
- **Schema definitions**: Standardized way to describe data structure and types
- **Quality expectations**: SLAs, freshness requirements, and quality metrics
- **Ownership and governance**: Clear accountability and access controls
- **Versioning**: Managing contract evolution over time

### Open Data Product Standard

A framework for treating data as a product:
- **Product thinking**: Applying product management principles to data
- **Consumer-centric**: Designing data with end users in mind
- **Self-service**: Enabling teams to discover and use data independently
- **Federated governance**: Balancing autonomy with compliance

## Impact

These standards enable organizations to:
- **Improve data quality**: Clear contracts prevent misunderstandings
- **Accelerate development**: Teams spend less time on integration
- **Enable self-service**: Consumers can discover and trust data products
- **Scale data platforms**: Federated approach allows growth without centralization bottlenecks

## My Contributions

As Technical Steering Committee member:
- Shape the technical direction of both standards
- Review and approve specification changes
- Advocate for enterprise adoption
- Bridge academic research with practical implementation

## Technologies & Concepts

- **Data Contracts**: Producer-consumer agreements for data
- **Data Products**: Packaged, discoverable data assets
- **Data Mesh**: Decentralized data architecture
- **Schema Evolution**: Managing changes over time
- **Data Governance**: Policy enforcement at scale

## Outcome

The Open Data Contract Standard is gaining adoption across industries, helping organizations build more reliable, scalable data platforms. By establishing common standards, we're enabling better collaboration between data teams and improving data quality across the ecosystem.
