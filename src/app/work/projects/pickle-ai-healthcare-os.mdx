## Overview

Pickle is the operating system for healthcare recruiting, built for in-house teams. We built the identity layer for healthcare by creating a comprehensive data ingestion engine that unifies 15M+ clinician profiles with 40+ fields - 4x LinkedIn's coverage in healthcare.

## The Problem

Healthcare recruiting is broken. Roles typically take 6 months to fill due to:
- Lack of unique identifiers for clinicians
- Manual credential verification processes
- Fragmented data across licensing boards and registries
- Time-intensive outreach and screening

## The Solution

Pickle tackles this with three core innovations:

### 1. Healthcare Identity Layer

Our data ingestion engine pulls from:
- **Primary sources**: NPI registry, state licensing boards, billing data
- **Secondary datasets**: Web scrapes, exclusive partner data

We run entity resolution to unify records into 15M+ profiles with comprehensive fields including licenses, certifications, employment history, clinical settings, and contact information.

### 2. AI-Powered Recruiting Agents

Recruiters search in natural language to describe their ideal candidates, then AI agents handle:
- **Multi-channel outreach**: Voice, email, and LinkedIn with personalized context
- **Automated screening**: Validates profile data and handles scheduling
- **Credentialing coordination**: Streamlines verification with institutions and licensing boards

### 3. Speed at Scale

Roles that usually take 6 months to fill can now be filled in 7 days, allowing healthcare organizations to:
- Take on more patients
- Save on staffing costs
- Reduce recruiter burnout
- Scale hiring operations efficiently

## Technologies Used

- **Azure Container Apps**: Cloud-native microservices architecture
- **AI/ML Pipeline**: Custom entity resolution and conversational agents
- **Next.js**: Fast, responsive frontend
- **CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipelines

## Impact

- **28%+ reduction** in hiring times
- **15M+ clinician profiles** (4x LinkedIn's healthcare coverage)
- **40+ data fields** per profile
- **6 months → 7 days** average time to fill

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was building accurate entity resolution for healthcare professionals who lack unique identifiers. We developed proprietary algorithms that combine fuzzy matching, credential information, and candidate history correlation to achieve high accuracy.

We also under estimated some of the healthcare specific UI nuances to turn this project from a nice-to-have to a fully loveable product. 

## Outcome

Pickle is now helping healthcare organizations dramatically accelerate their hiring processes, enabling them to address staffing shortages and improve patient care delivery. The platform has become essential infrastructure for in-house healthcare recruiting teams across the country.
